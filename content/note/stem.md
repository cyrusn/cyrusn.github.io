# Some Idea from 青年會書院
- PE, HE is the great media for implementation of STEM
    - VR 眼鏡，360 3D camera, student rided a bicycle with the camera, and other student can watch in VR and ride in 跑步機
    - PE 心跳帶，跑步統計，Data colloction
    - RFID 收集跑圈時間
    - 分子雪糕 in HE
- Others
    - AR in book, the video will show the book introduction
    - HE + Bio 水耕活動
    - 滑翔機 => 飛幾遠 => 估算
- STEM Lab? 
- Digital Learning Common (數位學習共享空間)
- 環保飯堂 + STEM + 影音室
    - 3D Printing, 青書Cafe, food printing 立體食物打印機
    - Student Cafe
    - [3D Food Printers: How They Could Change What You Eat | Digital Trends][&12]
- 2D design => 3D design => 3D printing
- tinkercad 3D 繪圖工具
- 如何照顧不同學習需要的學生
- 各活動設計，應有關連
- 活動設計應有深度，3D print 舊膠 vs print 野食？
- student are makers
    + 3D printing to make a camera mount, snap the view of moon
- F1 - F3 Micro:bit
    + 中一習作 Micro Bit to 計步器
        * Friction (physic)
        * m -> km (math)
    + F3 Sensor 濕度，𣺉水
- DIY Hologram
    + 平截頭體的應用
- 老師們要有共同願境
- 只有頭中尾三次Meeting
    + but whatsapp idea
    + Discussion
- 比同事時間及空間, they need to have time to think to develop too
    + 老師才可以發展
    + 能否突出老師們的長處?
- IT Support / wifi
