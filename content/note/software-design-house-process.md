- User requirement
  + meeting with customer
  + determine requirements and flow
- UI mock up, storyboard
- setup milestones
  + usually the project will be too big to implement in one shot
  + divide it into milestones and gather feedback on each
  + usually we use features to divide milestone
  + also take note of the the delivery date of each milestone (see next)
- task list and schedule
  + divide feature into tasks
  + assign developers to each task
  + resources should be fully utilized
  + reserve time before delivery date for integration and QA
- intermittent releases (release candidates)
  + these are sub-milestones within the development team
  + QA can test on RC for completed features and bugfixes
