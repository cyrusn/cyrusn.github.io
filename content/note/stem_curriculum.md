# Model
- TPACK
- SMAR
- [SetoWS_CoE_20170221_public (for EDB Web)][@1]

# Curriculum design
- first year
    + learning
    + tasks / experiment on suitable topics
- second year
    + learning
    + tasks / experiment on suitable topics
    + maybe simple project
- third year
    + learning (1st term)
    + tasks / experiment on suitable topics
    + final project (2nd term)

# Content

Which topic should be included in the curriculum for students whose age are 12 - 16?

## Science
- Concept of Experiments
- fair test
- General Science Topics that already in school curriculum, e.g.
  + DNA
  + Reaction
  + Ray diagram
  + etc

## Technology
- Basic knowledge on Raspberry Pi (each student deserves 1 rpi)
- Basic knowledge on input and output
- Basic programming (Python and Linux environment)
- Software Design

## Enginering
- Basic knowledge on electricity and circuit
- Basic sensors or electronic chip like resistant, capacitor, LED, LDR etc...
- Basic mechanics including motors, joint, gear etc ...
- Product Design
- 3D Printing and laser cut
- Drawing (aided with software)

## Math
- Ideas (refer to the book named "Computer science distill")
- Big O notation => counting time and counting memory 
- Defining Project Objectives (including scale analysis, technical requirement)
- Basic Knowledge on statistic
- Counting
- Probability
- Logic (True False Table, how to do addition by using logic operator)
- Basic knowledge on ratio, rate, area and volume
- Mathematic Modelling

## Others
- Creativity
- Basic knowledge on production cost and profit, especially for mass production.
- Project Management (Division of Labor, man Day, cost, profit, presentation, sale strategy)

# Assessment
- Exam or project?


# Ideas
- 10 Projects Junior students about Raspberry Pi (with cookbook)
- Set up and manage your Raspberry Pi
- Connect the Pi to a network
- Work with its Linux-based operating system
  + make friend with text-editor
- Use the Piâ€™s ready-made software
- Program Raspberry Pi with Python
- Control hardware through the GPIO connector
- Use Raspberry Pi to run different types of motors
- Work with switches, keypads, and other digital inputs
- Hook up sensors for taking various measurements
- Attach different displays, such as an LED matrix
- Create dynamic projects with Raspberry Pi and Arduino
