## What can I learn right now in just 10 minutes that could be useful for the rest of my programming career?

> That programming is about solving problems, not writing code. Here are the four basic tasks that an individual programmer must perform.

> 1. Define the problem (requirements and constraints).
> 2. Define the solution (algorithms and data structures).
> 3. Express the solution in code.
> 4. Prove and/or test correctness.
